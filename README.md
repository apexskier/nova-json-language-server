⚠️ **Archived**: Although it was fun to build my nova extensions, I haven't ended up using Nova regularly and can't devote the time to maintenance. Feel free to reach out if you want to fork and start maintaining an alternative.

# JSON support for Nova

This is a plugin providing advanced JSON language support for the new [Nova editor from Panic](https://panic.com/nova/).

This uses [vscode-json-languageserver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vscode-json-languageserver) internally.
